	<h3>A tool for developing rhetorical wit.</h3>
	<p>Click the "Show Person" button to show a picture. As fast as you can, think of something you would
		say to the person. Consider his/her surroundings, jewelry, clothing, etc. If you get an image multiple
		times, build up a mental collection of things you can say to someone every time you see him/her in
		that particular scenario.</p>
